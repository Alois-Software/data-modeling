"Supporting someone to stand.

Step 1: Feet forward and flat (right under knee)

Step 2: Hands rest on something with which to push against (arms of chair, your
own legs, seat, etc.)

Step 3: Lean forward (more forward, more forward, more)

Step 4: Push with your legs to stand (once the weight is over the feet, legs start
pushing)

Step 5: Tuck hips forward and straighten back

Tip: Use rhythm to help them stand by using a gentle rocking forward movement with the words Onnnne...Twooo...Threeee (and on three they should stand)

I asked him how they felt. He so genuinely looked at me and said ""I can see all your wrinkles now."" Oddly enough it made me laugh - we both did. Last week he suffered a tripple A abdominal aortic aneurism. I have not lost his body but I have lost his mind. As hard as this disease is I would have gladly taken years more of this sweet alzheimers husband of mine and relished the funny - and the hard moments.

"Dementia is a process – it’s not something that happens overnight or at a predictable pace ⏳.

 The early signs of dementia can be very subtle, and often present symptoms that could be confused with depression, infections, or vitamin and hormone deficiencies. Because of this, dementia is sometimes misdiagnosed or overlooked in the earlier stages.

Don't ignore the symptoms and go seek medical  advice!   ''        .

"I think I've posted before about how crappy my marriage was before his diagnosis. He truly was not the best Husband. Anyway, am I the only one who finds it extremely difficult to deal with this? I mean for me, the love was gone years ago. It's so hard putting up with this with a person you no longer love, but care a lil bit about. I hate he is going through what he's going through. BUT, I also hate that I'm the one who has to deal with it on a full-time basis.

Everything he does, or don't do aggravates the hell out of me. He can't follow simple instructions, He's hiding every damn thing in the house, I can't find any of my sharp knives. He walks around ALL day drinking soda and spilling it everywhere. He hides soda's and Water bottles in the damn freezer behind other food. Then they burst, and I have a mess to clean up. When he's not doing that he's hovering over me like a damn gnat.

If I'm in the basement, he will sneak halfway down the steps and watch me. When he hears me coming he'll run back up the stairs. No matter what you ask him, he didn't do it, or it wasn't him. We are the only 2 people in the house. He talks to those invisible guys all day and night. Everything he does drives me up the wall.

I find myself yelling at him all the time. I know that's not good, but he literally makes me sick. He's useless, ugh. I hate that I feel this way but I can't help it. I ask God to give me strength and patience. But, it's not working.

Can anyone else relate, or is it just me?

Addendum: Let me just say this, The fact that I don't love him will never cause me to give him anything but the best of care. I just hate having to give up my life for a person who doesn't deserve my love and kindness, if that makes sense."

My lo is 58 and his EAOD seems to be progressing very quickly. It's like he is aging overnight. One thing that has happened is a sudden onset of arthritis in his hands. We are waiting for him to be approved for Medicaid and this is the third time at the ER for this condition. His hands look like they're claws and he can't even open a bottle of water. His skin is aging and getting thin. He has lesions all over his head and both sides of his face. Does this sound familiar to anyone else? Just looking for solutions.
"I am so glad y'all are here and I have found this support group! My hubby is going to a neurologist July 6th to finally get checked for dementia! He is 60 years old but he has been having memory issues (general forgetfulness for the past 10 years), he has been handling that ok. He has done things to cope that I didn't even pay attention to until just recently, like park in the same area at the stores he goes to because he has lost his car before, leaves his wallet and cell phone the same place every night (but now he forgets that), puts every single thing in his notes and writes everything down in his calendar so he doesn't forget (but he still does). Now things are getting worse, he is losing spaces in time. He will ask me a question like, where are we going out to dinner, or if we are at a restaurant ask if are order was taken yet over and over....He also has a hard time following netflix series and of course, gets upset if I try to explain anything. I keep trying to tell myself he is stressed at work or its the normal aging process but I am a nurse and it all seems to point to dementia. Has anyone known it to be so slow, to go for 10 years without progressing? I am happy for this but now I am concerned because the last year it's gotten worse, way worse!! Thanks!"
Does anyone give their LO CBD? Any luck with it?

"Hi everyone! This is my first post and first time to the group. Looking for support, guidance and wisdom while navigating this journey. My 60 year old brother-in-law was scene once or twice by a general practitioner and diagnosed with moderate Early onset dementia with Lewy body. A neurologist appt was made but he wouldn't go and is fighting this the entire way. Hallucinations have set in, lots of forgetfulness occur now on a daily basis as well as threats of suicide quite frequent. Anger and denial is a whole new level. The only caregiver he has in his 85 year old Mom that lives next door and provides for his every need. He does have 3 young adult kids all who live out of town as well as 3 brothers, 1 is my husband and we live in Oklahoma and he is in Florida. He is unemployed and therefore has no medical insurance and is to young to be eligible to receive Medicare.

I write all this just to put the situation out there and see if there is anyone else that finds themselves in a similar situation. We are at a loss as to how to help him. When he's threatening suicide or acts out in anger whether it's verbal or physical the police have been called out for wellness checks and we feel they are being ignored or not taken seriously. At this point since he refuses to go to the Dr. we feel like maybe we can get him taken to the hospital for a mental evaluation? No one wants that to happen but we are just not sure what to do or how to handle this.

Thank you for reading this if you have made it to the end! I helps to have a group like this to help you feel like we are not in this alone."

"Has anyone not treated an infection such as a UTI? Hospice brought up today that I wouldn’t have to treat another one. This had never occurred to me.

It is something I’m thinking about though ....if I were as advanced as her, I wouldn’t want to be here"
"So! Today not so good. My LO {mom} told me to shut up, i was full of shit , and F-you. Because i wont let her go outside by herself.

Earlier this evening we received a call from a small group of young teenagers who had come across an elderly male with memory problems, the group while waiting for the Police to arrive did a brilliant job reassuring the male and keeping him safe while waiting for help. We were then able to locate the males next of kin and return him safely home.

We think its really important for out community to know we have some great young people out there who really do make Windsor & Maidenhead a great place to live. well done to those involved. #C9902"

"Y'all my LO is on her 7th day of no food and 5th day of no water. How long can she go on this way? She's in the ""actively "" dying stage. I'm so sad for her. I just want her to be free.
How long?"
"Do any of you who are living with your LO, just the 2 of you, feel alone. Sometimes my mother can converse, play scrabble, yahtzee...and more often she just rocks in her chair, staring off, and doesn't even acknowledge when I speak to her. So frustrating! I'm sure it's just the disease but lots of frustration and loneliness."

"Hello, Members!
I can't believe how fast this group is growing!
It means a lot to me to see that members are talking to each other & helping one another with caring and respectful attitudes! When I was in the thick of my dementia journey caring for my mother-in-law, I was sitting at the kitchen table feeling exhausted, sad and very alone. When my thinking cleared a little, I realized that there were people all around the planet...likely sitting at their kitchen table feeling much the same. A short time later this group was born in the hopes that it would be a type of vehicle in bringing people together to support each other...people lost in the whirlwind of pain and frustration that this merciless disease creates.
Currently, I am the only admin...and I'll admit...it's becoming a little challenging to keep up with it considering all of the other demands that I'm facing daily. It's so very important to me that people who turn to this group get the help and support that they are needing so badly! So...given all of this, I'm putting out a call for persons who have dementia experience/knowledge (you don't have to have a medical degree...although we would love to have you if you do!) to let me know if you would be willing to become a moderator in this group. It would involve approving...or denying requests to join the group, responding to members' questions and concerns, providing support and encouragement as well as deleting any inappropriate posts and/or comments. Must have a caring heart. Best pay on the planet...knowing that you just might have reduced some of the pain and suffering in the world!! 

UPDATE: People responded to my plea! We have had several exceptional people step up to the plate as admins!! They are huge blessings to this group and I appreciate them beyond words! DCSG has grown so large and keeps growing rapidly...so I am still looking for moderators who can help support and effectively monitor this group. If that sounds like you (even if you can only manage coming on for short periods of time most days,) please reach out to me in a private message."
"My MIL has some of the best genes known to man. That is why I am posting her picture. She is 84 years young. She does have dementia, sadly. She does still live alone at home. She no longer drives. My husband and I spend one week per month with her, her daughter spends every weekend with her, and my daughter and her family spends Wednesday evenings with her. We want to keep her at home as long as possible as long as she is relatively safe. Her PCP advised us that placing her in a home will cause her to decline quickly.

My question - what is your experience with Wet Macular Degeneration? She has Dry Macular Degeneration in her right eye and requires no treatment at this time. She has Wet Macular Degeneration in her left eye and is receiving injections monthly by her retina doc. We are beginning to wonder if she needs to continue these treatments. She hates the injections and says there is no improvement.

She is the healthiest person I know. She takes no medications but does have her annual checkups just to make sure she doesn’t need medications.

BTW, we would bring her to our house before we let her go into a facility. Earlier this year we had some remodeling done to her home of the last 65 years. The entire time she was here, she experienced major memory problems. She thought our 38 year old son was 4 yrs old and kept looking for him, etc. when we took her back home, she got back to her old self.

BTW, in this picture she is picking Louisiana blue berries in her daughter’s backyard."
"I know in the bigger picture this is petty…. But this was the worst Father’s Day I’ve ever had. 4 hours of ignoring me this morning because she was mad that I asked her NOT to call me her attractive Lover or handsome boyfriend/date to the tables around us in the restaurant yesterday. I sucked it up and took her out today. I sat in TJ Maxx, Marshall’s, and lunch when I wasn’t hungry. Came home and she wants me to do this, do that, fix her IPad, clean up her spills, go through and box up books. Etc. I’M TIRED and want to just have a little quiet or special time with my Fiancé. God knows how I got engaged during this shit show I’m living…. 11:30pm at night now and I just want to go to bed but she’s puttering around the house. Yesterday I also had to turn our stove off of high heat with an empty pan on it because she forgot. I really can’t take much more, but tomorrow is another day. God please give me strength and a better attitude tomorrow."
"Edited... psych meds! Sorry!

We may have made a big mistake putting mom in memory care.

Sure, they have found some medical problems we didn't know mom had, but I don't feel she is being taken care of the way I expected for 5,000 a month!

Where are all the little tricks they promised to get mom to do things?

They can't force her to do anything so she'll walk around in her own filth because she doesn't want them to wash her?
She can walk around in her own filth at home.
She can not take her meds at her own house.
She can sleep on her own couch instead of theirs.
And so many other things.

They are just now putting her on meds, it's been 10 days since she arrived.
I called to chew them a new one today. We will see what happens from here.

"Hi all. I guess I should mention I’m a nurse and my older sister isn’t, but I tell her things and it goes in one ear and out the other. Pleas also note we have a paid caregiver who only works at my sister’s; she won’t come here anymore. Maybe because I want her to do things the right way?

I’m taking care of my 74 year old mom along with my sister; we alternate weeks. Last time I had her she came to me with redness on her bottom that I started treating, and when she left to go to my sister’s, it was better. I told my sister what to do, and I knew she’d gotten that way while she was there. My sister said ‘well, she won’t let the caregiver change her, so we can’t do anything’ and I told her she needs to stay off her bottom, kept clean, and to put the cream I gave her on everytime she’s changed or goes to bathroom.

My sister today, when we traded mom off, said they’d done everything like I said. Well I got her back today, and when I went to change her, her bottom looks like she’s been boiled! Bright red with peeling blisters, like she had 2nd degree burns.

I was so upset! I couldn’t help but start crying. I tried not to let mom know. I took photos. I cleaned her up, treated the awful areas and left her naked from gown down on bed pads and on her side with pillows and made her nice and cozy with blankets.

I know nobody is perfect, but is it too much to ask someone to just do the right thing for their mother? We’ve had lots of similar incidents. When I got married, my mom didn’t get a bath for the 10 days I was gone. I had to threaten to call APS to get her to take her blood sugar regularly.

Sorry this is so long. I’m just so upset. This happened about 10:30 my time (eastern US) and I’m still so upset I can’t stand it. Idk how I’ll sleep. Thanks for reading. I don’t want her to go back to her house."
"Hello, my 56 y/o father has dementia. His wife passed away 3 years ago, so he lives on his own. Currently, he's able to function on a day to day basis, but we don't know how quickly things will progress. Of course there are so many things to consider and I'm overwhelmed with where to start. The doctor suggested a book to read, which has been helpful (The 36 Hour Day) and we've hired an attorney to start a trust and make medical/financial arrangements. But, what are some things you wish you'd known when your LO was first diagnosed? What are some things you've purchased that you love and wish you'd had sooner? I just ordered a digital calendar/clock for him and I'd love some things to keep him more aware and keep us better organized. Thanks!"

"Sensory stimulation enables People with Dementia to be in the moment and engage with what is around them, as well as communicate in different ways. Being happily involved in stimulating activities helps reduce agitation, anxiety, depression, and anger among People with Dementia.

You can help them stay engaged and connected and enjoy a better quality of life by organising various activities important to them.

“We'll meet again
Don't know where
Don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
'Till the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away.”
The words that Dame Vera Lynn sang all those years ago still resonate today and that’s why we want you to tune into BBC One at 9pm on Friday 8 May to join us for a ‘We’ll meet again’ singalong. Until then, enjoy this lovely rendition from some familiar faces."

"The purpose of WEAAD is to provide an opportunity for communities around the world to create awareness and a better understanding of abuse and neglect of older persons through cultural, social, economic, and demographic processes.

Elder abuse cases are on the rise, as per data recorded by the Elders Helpline, Bengaluru.

From 174 in 2016-2017 to 264 in 2018-19, the data also revealed that while 60 percent of elders have stated that they face some kind of abuse, only 18 percent of them came forward to report it.

Just being aware of The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 is not enough. It is important to provide older adults and their caregivers with knowledge on how to report abuse.

Share this to as many people as you can, let's spread the message, and do our part for the wellbeing of our elders.

"My husbands friend asked him to play guitar at church. He must get his fingers back in shape. As I have noticed he practiced once and that was it for the month.

The other day I asked him if he remembers how to play. He said no I don’t. Is this a possibility? Playing was an important role in his life."
"Hi. My mum has mixed dementia (vascular & alzh) she is later stage. Still recognises family and tries to communicate. We still get her up daily and she moves from bedroom to sofa in sitting room.
Last couple of days she’s been crying out in pain and holding her head. Lying down or sitting up makes no difference.
Drs been and seemed to think it was neck related. And there maybe an infection. So antibiotics prescribed and ibuprofen gel prescribed.
Today she seems worse. Any ideas? is this perhaps common at this stage?
Hard to watch her suffering and have no idea what to do.
Dr will visit again later today."
Can I ask other members who have vascular dementia if they are finding it difficult to have a appetite? And has your tastes changed? I.e. I only seam to want sweet stuff..the more sugar the better..I had a episode the other night and I sort of came to I guess and I was standing in my kitchen with a spoon and a jar of chocolate spread  just wondering if others have had similar experiences x
"I'm constantly astounded by the speed of this insidious illness in my Godmother. She has no family at all, so I'm all she's got. By the beginning of September last year, I called her GP to ask about getting her tested as she seemed to be struggling to manage time and look after herself properly. The country was in lockdown and I lived 85 miles away. Her GP did nothing and as she was not remembering to eat and drink properly, she was rushed to A&E by the end of the month. At that stage, she was just a bit forgetful. Here we are only nine months later and the difference is shocking. She is in a care home which she believes is actually a hotel that she owns. She has photos in her room of herself and her late husband which she thinks are photos of the couple she bought the hotel from. Apparently her curtains are actually a pair of trousers. She walks very slowly and constantly has balance problems. When she is back on good(ish) form, you have about 15 minutes at best before the effort of concentrating gets too much for her and she slips away into her world again.
We moved her to a care home 5 minutes away from us and my wife and I take her to a local cafe once a week now for coffee and cakes.
I'm trying to sort out her finances, late husbands estate and sell her house. I'm struggling to decide just how to plan someone's finances and care when I have no idea how long I need to plan for? All the info on the Internet suggests that she has anywhere from 3 to 5 years left. Yet, in 9 months, she has gone from having very mild dementia to having severe dementia and she's losing both her mobility and her bowel control.

The one thing I hang on to at the moment is that she's happy. She loves the ""hotel"", the food and all her new friends. She has no idea she can't remember things because if she can't remember something then she doesn't know she has forgotten it and she makes things up in her mind to fill in the gaps. I don't know how long she has left but I just hope and pray that she remains happy."

"I read these testimonials of fellow caregivers and feel guilt over not knowing how to deal with this insidious disease that is eating up my genius husband of 45 years. I am impatient at times and say things I shouldn’t. I am angry over the loss of our golden years, yet committed to caring him to the threshold as I promised him so many decades ago. I miss him already and he is still here. Bless you all and your journey with your loved one."

"Each day, I visit my husband’s assisted living facility, and I bring him a treat. He loves malteds. I wanted to call his mom on the Alexa Show, but he didn’t want to talk. He doesn’t need to talk. She wants to just “see” him. Other than lots of pain from spinal stenosis and arthritis, she’s in good shape for a 95 year old. Her mind is very sharp and she feels bad that her son has Vascular Parkinsonism and Vascular Dementia. I call her when I get home, but she wants me to call her when I’m there. I’m not sure what I should do."

Today is The Queen’s 95th birthday.

The Queen was born at 2.40am on 21 April 1926 at 17 Bruton Street in Mayfair, London. She was the first child of The Duke and Duchess of York, who later became King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.

This year Her Majesty remains at Windsor Castle, during a period of Royal Mourning following the death of The Duke of Edinburgh."
"Sometimes feelings and emotions can cause People with Dementia to behave in ways that are unusual to them and are a result of the Dementia condition. These behaviours can sometimes challenge others to understand what the person is communicating.

This is why we've founded 'ADS' 10 years ago – to help people in the local community whose lives are directly or indirectly affected by Dementia.

Don't be afraid to ask for help! We, the team of Alzheimers Dementia Support 'ADS' Charity are here ready to support you.

Remember that WE are here for YOU with thoughtful support and guidance!

March 22, 2020 at 10:23 AM ·

So I'm a postie and would like to inform you some important information. We deliver your parcel and letters.

What you may not be aware of is we are classed as keyworkers through these terrible times.

The CWU have offered us to become an emergency service for the public. If things get worse your postie could be delivering healthcare products, food and even medication.

All that is asked from the public is:

1) Think about safety first, for yours and the postie.

2) If you see a postie coming towards your door please (DO NOT OPEN YOUR DOOR). We will sign your parcels and letters for you.
We will leave the parcel, food or medication on your doorstep and then knock. Give the postie enough time to step away from the door.

3) If you are already outside your house, go inside or step away 2 metres from your postie. Please do not approach your postie.
If we tell you to stop and back off or close your door, don't feel offended. We are only trying to help protect you from this virus.

Hi. I have just joined this group as my mum has just been diagnosed with mixed dementia. I'm feeling very sad and overwhelmed with so much to learn about the disease and the support available. My dad is on end of life in a nursing home. My sisters do not live nearby. I hope to glean a lot of info and wisdom from you all. And maybe some support too.
Doctor informed me today that I could start giving my mother 2 of her 10 mg Memantine pills per day instead of the usual one. It was more or less a suggestion for her dementia. Anybody notice a difference between 10 mg vs 20mg daily?

FEEDBACK.....

Hi Norman,
The MP3 players have been an amazing tool for our patients living with dementia... They have provided such a calming influence.. some patients have found them so beneficial when they are in a busy ward dorm and a lot is going on and they just want to zone out and relax.. the music provided has been great for interaction also, some patients have remembered the words to some of the songs on the MP3 players and enjoy having a sing-song with myself. They have helped me to ensure the patients living with a dementia diagnosis and in-hospital have some more comfort... they have also helped me to identify the type of music the patients enjoy which is a great conversation starter. I wish to think you ever so much for the much-appreciated donation of the players, they have made such a difference..

Many thanks

"hello lovelies

update on my mom. apparently, after 70 yrs of NOT playing a piano, my mother went to her regularly scheduled day service facility, sat down at the paino, and started playing... just like that.

i am stunned. my entire life, my mother never once played the piano. the closest she came to playing, we stopped in a high end piano shop doing saturday errands, (when she was in her early 40's, i was in my early teens), she played a couple of chords (?) as if she was going to play but a salesman came up and said something to her, and she got irritated and ushered us both out quickly.
i asked her then if she knew how to play and if she would teach me. she told me the only thing she knew how to play were scales. (i thought to myself, ""bs, not after what i just heard""

i am delighted and fearful as i am not sure how long this will last. do i need to make dr appts for her? is this the plaques and tangles affecting different parts of the brain? or? is she just feeling good enough to reawaken a part of her she kept hidden for decades?

thank you everyone, and many blessings"
"Can I remind members that the group is not to be used for promoting products or items for financial gain or otherwise, as per group rules. Many thanks."
"hi everyone! my mom is in her late 40’s and was just in mexico caring for her mom who is undiagnosed but clearly has dementia.
my mom has taken some of the things my grandma has said to her very personally. she seems to think my grandma is attacking her.
my mom also has CPTSD and depression.
i don’t want to repeat the things shes said to her but they’re hurtful.
dementia isn’t something widely known or talked about where my mom is from.
i did provide her some info and she said she’d read about it.
i guess my main question is: how can i support my mom from afar?
she returns in a week; how can i support her and help her understand that her mom wasn’t attacking her, just simply isn’t in her right mind anymore?
she seems to be in denial and having a hard time coping/understanding"
"My Mum gained her angel wings yesterday. She was admitted to hospital 2 weeks ago with head pains. It was a severe tia that caused serious damage. We got her home Wednesday this week to rest her last few days in familiar surrounding with family and friends.
We were supported by hospice at home carers , these wonderful women showed so much kindness and respect for Mum and my family. Ensuring Mums dignity was managed at every step. We will never be able to thank them enough for their help over this last week.
Mum passed peacefully in my Dads arms with my brother and I by her side.
My heart is breaking but she’s free for this horrid disease now. We’ll miss her forever.
God bless you all."

125 Holes To Celebrate 125 Years

Les has set himself the challenge of completing 125 holes of golf in one single day, which will work out to be around 560 shots throughout the day (or could it be more?)

He will be joined on his 7 rounds by 1 other golfer for each round, including our Vice-Captain, our 2018 Club Captain, a representative from our dear friends in the Nippon Club, a close friend of Les, our Golf Operations Manager, our Centenary Year Captain and finally our Club President.

In order to raise funds for the Captains Charity, Les would appreciate your sponsorship for this event and such a fantastic cause using the Just Giving donation page below:



Les is incredibly grateful for your invaluable sponsorship and support you can offer him to get him through this historic day!

More details will follow regarding any celebrations we have planned once he’s completed his round! But in the meantime, please save the date so that you can celebrate with Les at his 126th hole when he completes his 125th hole!

Natasha's words about what she is doing and why:
""In March 2019, my Daughter Anastasia surprised me by involving me in the BBC One programme, All Around to Mrs Browns. Along with an amazing experience, I won a 15,000 ft skydive! Something I have always wanted to try, but always found a reason not to, well, because I’m a little terrified of the idea.

So on the 20/07/2019, I am going to do it! And I thought, what a great opportunity to raise some money for charity (and a great way to give me the motivation to not chicken out, haha).

In aid of Alzheimers and Dementia Support, and more specifically my dearest friend in the world, Joan, who gracefully lost her fight last year, I am jumping out of a plane! It’d mean a great deal if I could have your support. Any donation would mean the world. And of course it’ll be repaid with hysterical footage of the event itself. Wish me luck!""

Brought my lo for a visit . Really hope this memory care center gets there&×+# together! I have already called the corporate office about the neglect I have witnessed they have not done what they said they would do for my husband.
"Things are getting really strange. Sitting in the living room talking to my daughter and playing with my grandson. All the sudden my husband asked what happen to the tv! We are like what? He says, the tv is black, no picture. What happen to the movie? The tv has not been on for days!
And lately he answers questions that have nothing to do with what we are talking about. Like we might be talking about pizza. He will say, you can fill that with gas.
So confusing. Guess he is getting worst, as this is new behavior."

"Reaching Out in Love – Chapter 2-32: This week, Jean takes over the reins for a while to talk about her journey caring for someone with a neurodegenerative disease. She brings a perspective that should be valuable to everyone. She had her first contact with the disease that would eventually kill her husband and daughter when she was a 19 year old bride.The bigger problem, though, was that nobody wanted to talk about what was going on.

We pray that these posts are a blessing.

"I am really not sure what I am expecting from this post.

My mum is 60 was diagnosed at 54 but showing signs since 52, the last 5 days have been hell for my dad, my mum has now decided that I have stolen all her jewellery and one of my friends Jewellery and apparently she has seen my husband taking money out of her purse. She is refusing to see me and has told my dad a few times now to call the police on me.

If I call her she tells me I have to admit to it and screams at me. Says things like I have a free car and fuel but it wasn't enough I had to steal from her.

I am hoping this is just a faze and she will get over it.

But in the mean time anyone go through this, what could I do? This is one think I will not go along with"
"For your information:
The minor illness and injury unit at St Marks Hospital, Maidenhead, is to be temporarily suspended as part of the national effort to combat Covid-19 (coronavirus).
The impact of the virus and the national lockdown – with most people now staying at home as instructed – has resulted in attendances at the minor injury unit at St Mark’s Hospital, in Maidenhead, falling by 74 per cent.

In order to make the best use of resources, local NHS commissioners have taken the decision to suspend the minor illness and injury unit at St Marks for the remainder of the pandemic.

"Please has anyone experienced this... my mol has Alzheimer’s. Within the past 6 months she went from assistant living to the memory care unit. She’s was hospitalized for three weeks because she can’t sleep and is very unsteady. They kept her in one of those beds with a net around it to keep her safe, but she has the need to move all the time. And she still was not getting any sleep at night in the hospital. Anywhere from 30 min to 2 hours a night and it’s not like she is taking giant naps during the day. The doctors said they’re frustrated too and have adjusted meds several times. No improvement. She’s back in memory care now and they called and said they don’t think they’re gonna be able to take care of her because she will not stop moving. She keeps walking up and down the hall. Pushing her walker the wrong way, all sweaty and worn out, and won’t stop. Still no sleep. They think she might have to go to a psych ward. We live right down the street from her and see her everyday. We cry all the time. It’s all we think about. My mom lives with us and I have to do everything for her. It’s just so much and why can’t my mol stay still?? It’s killing us seeing her go through this!! Thanks for listening and input. God bless."

"How do I try to convince my LO to spend at least a few months with their eldest child and see grandkids to give me a break from having to care for them for over a year? My brother is more than willing to take in our Dad for a while and has the space, but he doesn’t want to stay longer than a few days. My brother lives over 1,000 miles away so just a few days isn’t worth the trip. I need to be able to focus on my life for a while. I’m angry/depressed all the time, my relationship is dying, and it’s now affecting my career. This is the only option I can think of as he won’t go into assisted living and we’ve tried multiple in-home care agencies that either took advantage of him or weren’t worth the money spent. I’m at the end of my rope and I don’t feel like it’s fair that I carry all the burden of this horrible disease. It’s either he go or I just pick up and go at this point..."

"We just moved my mom into the house. She has moderate dementia, but gets around well. My problem is dealing with her incontinence. She has to wear a pull-up because of lack of good bladder control, and she really can’t tell when she didn’t hold it or not. She needs to change her pull-up when she wakes up and when she goes to bed, but when I mention it she loses her temper at me and I lose mine. Tonight, she announced she was going to bed. I notice her pants were wet so I ask her to check her underwear. It went downhill pretty fast. Any advice on this would be great. Just as a little more background, mom doesnt deal with grief normally. She typically gets angry. My brother died 10 years ago and since then she has taken her anger out on me. We have talked about it, but old habits die hard and when I mention something she doesn’t like the anger resurfaces like tonight."
"Dementia At Home

"I feel like I willingly volunteered to be a prisoner. I can’t live a life in a few hours a week, and sure as hell can’t live a life in a few days off (if I were to get any)… I don’t know I guess feeling like shit every day just comes with the territory… Are there any caregivers out there that don’t feel rundown, used, and abused? What’s your secret?"
"Do anyone's family continue to keep telling you that your LO needs to be put into a memory care facility? I moved my mom in with my husband and myself last December. Yes our lives are crazy busy, we own a trucking company, we raise Texas Longhorns...."
"Hi all, when does this ever end, I just spoke to my mother in the care facility and she keeps on saying how can you do this to me (putting her in the care facility) mom is 84 at the end of our conversation she hung up on me.
It does hurt to hear her so upset and angry at me every day.
Today she is stating I am going to regret this decision keeping her in the facility vs being home with me. The back story is I have had her living with me since 2009 and the past 3 years under hospice care in my home at which time I hired a caregiver while I am at work. This past Nov she now has been in and out of the hospital 13x. She is angry at the world but most of all me. I have been so honest with her that I cannot take care of her any longer nor to be honest its taken a toll on me and my wellness and because of this I feel so guilty. Every day she fights with me and cries, I am at the point where I dread the daily calls as she knows how to push my buttons. I am the only child and have no one to share taking care of her, but I do have a cousin that she adores but I don't see her saying I can help. I want the best for my mom, how can you love the parent but cannot deal with them or even like them anymore. My heart is heavy but my mind says I have done the right thing for her. I had a knee replacement 4 weeks ago and I am still recovering, please understand I do love my mom but I just can't do this with her anymore. I Apologize for venting and I am not looking for anything. As I realize she may be right I will regret this Decision someday.

Thank you all for listening. GOD BLESS &
I APOLOGIZE FOR THIS LONG WINDED NOTE"
I've been doing a lot of thinking about what if I end up with dementia. I don't want my family to have to deal with all these things us as caregivers go through. However I don't want to be in a home alone with no friends or family. I'm really struggling with how I want to inform my family of my wishes if and when the time comes.
"I needed this today, on Father’s Day."
"Mom just told me she don't feel good. She telling me she don't want to go to the hospital but thinks she may need to. She keeps saying she isnt gonna make it. She told me she was scared..we talked a little about heaven and how she is saved and will be with daddy again so don't be scared. Should i call the hospice nurse? She has been declining for a while and they say not much longer but have not called it activly dying. Yall im a mess and all alone!! She don't seem physically worse than I've seen her but she has never talked about ""she don't think she gonna make it to tomorrow"" either."
