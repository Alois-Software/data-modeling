"Why me?
I think I have lived a life full of empathy and concern for others. My LO and I have taken people into our home and let them stay for extended times when there was a need. We took in foster kids, we have invited some to come into our home permanently. We even took a woman in as our child along with her two children which soon became three. We even raised the third one, helped her through college. Why in the world would God allow my beloved husband to have dementia and me have to be his full-time caretaker. It isn’t fair.
These are my thoughts and I want to make it clear that I don’t do any of what I think all the time. I do have a strong faith in God and I believe He is good, only good and He has been good to us. The blessings having those I mentioned is more than I can ever express. Our young lady we raised is truly a blessing, we would not have wanted to miss. We wanted her and raised her as our own child.
However, now is the darkness like I have never experienced before and I am afraid it will never end. I am also afraid that when it does end, it won’t be better. I am not coping without counseling and medication. My anger and rage scare me at times and I feel like I just can’t go another day.
While that is all true, I am doing some things that are helping me cope. First, I accept help from my family. My step-daughter comes in and spends afternoons here and I take advantage of that and leave his care to her; even when I sometimes feel guilty that she is doing things that I ought to be doing. I also listen to music, read, write. I go to exercise class again at the expense of my stepdaughter.
Most of all I am not allowing myself to internalize the anger. I bang things around sometimes. I yell. My LO is deaf which helps! However, I have yelled when help is here. I cry and don’t try to stop. And I admit that I am not happy. This is not how I want to live and I refuse to try to think I will adjust and it will be alright. It isn’t alright. My husband was the kindest, most versatile man. He loved people, everyone knew him and now he does not recognize his own family including me sometimes. I am a social person and I am stuck taking care of a man who always took care of me. It is not okay!!
My plan is to finish with him. I’ll be with him til he crosses from this life. But I will regret it has to be this way. It is not okay."
"Im tired. I have promised since I was a little girl that i would never ever put them in a nursing home.its as if they knew!!! Daddy took care of my mom the last 18 yrs of his life. There was no use to try to convince him to put her in....he never left the hospital...if she was admitted....then so was he pretty much. These last few years ive been telling my kids how I CANT do it if daddy goes first. Well aug 9*2020 we lost daddy. I took responsibility for mom and she kept asking ""what's gonna happen to me???"" At the time i just kept saying you will be fine,i will stay with you and we vwill see how it goes. Well we all can guess at how it went....im still here!!! My health,which was bad before,which is whybi kept saying i couldnt do it, well it has suffered a great deal. Its too late now, she has been on a steady slow decline for several months.
One day she cant talk,hear, move ,wake up, then next day she can do some Of those things. Its so up-down- up.....i would never place her at this point. I have been given all the tools, diapers instead of pull ups.mouth sponges,lemon qtips for the lips, morphine for the breathing, used only once, and drops for secretions again used once. She sleeps in a hospital bedvin the LR of a one bedroom apartment... was a very light sleeper. So... she sleeps entire apt shuts down...no cooking,no laundry, no cleaning....so i retreat to my room where still i must be ever so quiet. Ive lost all my energy as i spend over 12 hrs a day in that room!!! Im so tired. I hurt from lifting and pullung on her,my PC tells me it is our duty and deal with it. Pain mgmt Dr does not vwant me lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk!!! He suggested nursing care. I feel so all alone. I think once my job is done here i need to live with my daughter instead of on my own which is what i wanted. Moving in with mom took me from living with my ex. Actually he lived with me,just refused to leave.
I just feel so sad today. I try to think of my daddy today but my mind just won't allow it. Thanks for allowing me to vent... it helps!!! Prayers for everyone!!!"
