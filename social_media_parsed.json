    "text": "I think I've posted before about how crappy my marriage was before his diagnosis. He truly was not the best Husband. Anyway, am I the only one who finds it extremely difficult to deal with this? I mean for me, the love was gone years ago. It's so hard putting up with this with a person you no longer love, but care a lil bit about. I hate he is going through what he's going through. BUT, I also hate that I'm the one who has to deal with it on a full-time basis.\n\nEverything he does, or don't do aggravates the hell out of me. He can't follow simple instructions, He's hiding every damn thing in the house, I can't find any of my sharp knives. He walks around ALL day drinking soda and spilling it everywhere. He hides soda's and Water bottles in the damn freezer behind other food. Then they burst, and I have a mess to clean up. When he's not doing that he's hovering over me like a damn gnat.\n\nIf I'm in the basement, he will sneak halfway down the steps and watch me. When he hears me coming he'll run back up the stairs. No matter what you ask him, he didn't do it, or it wasn't him. We are the only 2 people in the house. He talks to those invisible guys all day and night. Everything he does drives me up the wall.\n\nI find myself yelling at him all the time. I know that's not good, but he literally makes me sick. He's useless, ugh. I hate that I feel this way but I can't help it. I ask God to give me strength and patience. But, it's not working.\n\nCan anyone else relate, or is it just me?\n\nAddendum: Let me just say this, The fact that I don't love him will never cause me to give him anything but the best of care. I just hate having to give up my life for a person who doesn't deserve my love and kindness, if that makes sense.",

He is 60 years old but he has been having memory issues (general forgetfulness for the past 10 years), he has been handling that ok. He has done things to cope that I didn't even pay attention to until just recently, like park in the same area at the stores he goes to because he has lost his car before, leaves his wallet and cell phone the same place every night (but now he forgets that), puts every single thing in his notes and writes everything down in his calendar so he doesn't forget (but he still does). Now things are getting worse, he is losing spaces in time. He will ask me a question like, where are we going out to dinner, or if we are at a restaurant ask if are order was taken yet over and over....He also has a hard time following netflix series and of course, gets upset if I try to explain anything. I keep trying to tell myself he is stressed at work or its the normal aging process but I am a nurse and it all seems to point to dementia. Has anyone known it to be so slow, to go for 10 years without progressing? I am happy for this but now I am concerned because the last year it's gotten worse, way worse!! Thanks!",

    "text": "Why me?\nI think I have lived a life full of empathy and concern for others. My LO and I have taken people into our home and let them stay for extended times when there was a need. We took in foster kids, we have invited some to come into our home permanently. We even took a woman in as our child along with her two children which soon became three. We even raised the third one, helped her through college. Why in the world would God allow my beloved husband to have dementia and me have to be his full-time caretaker. It isn\u2019t fair.\nThese are my thoughts and I want to make it clear that I don\u2019t do any of what I think all the time. I do have a strong faith in God and I believe He is good, only good and He has been good to us. The blessings having those I mentioned is more than I can ever express. Our young lady we raised is truly a blessing, we would not have wanted to miss. We wanted her and raised her as our own child.\nHowever, now is the darkness like I have never experienced before and I am afraid it will never end. I am also afraid that when it does end, it won\u2019t be better. I am not coping without counseling and medication. My anger and rage scare me at times and I feel like I just can\u2019t go another day.\nWhile that is all true, I am doing some things that are helping me cope. First, I accept help from my family. My step-daughter comes in and spends afternoons here and I take advantage of that and leave his care to her; even when I sometimes feel guilty that she is doing things that I ought to be doing. I also listen to music, read, write. I go to exercise class again at the expense of my stepdaughter.\nMost of all I am not allowing myself to internalize the anger. I bang things around sometimes. I yell. My LO is deaf which helps! However, I have yelled when help is here. I cry and don\u2019t try to stop. And I admit that I am not happy. This is not how I want to live and I refuse to try to think I will adjust and it will be alright. It isn\u2019t alright. My husband was the kindest, most versatile man. He loved people, everyone knew him and now he does not recognize his own family including me sometimes. I am a social person and I am stuck taking care of a man who always took care of me. It is not okay!!\nMy plan is to finish with him. I\u2019ll be with him til he crosses from this life. But I will regret it has to be this way. It is not okay.",

    "text": "Hi everyone! This is my first post and first time to the group. Looking for support, guidance and wisdom while navigating this journey. My 60 year old brother-in-law was scene once or twice by a general practitioner and diagnosed with moderate Early onset dementia with Lewy body. A neurologist appt was made but he wouldn't go and is fighting this the entire way. Hallucinations have set in, lots of forgetfulness occur now on a daily basis as well as threats of suicide quite frequent. Anger and denial is a whole new level. The only caregiver he has in his 85 year old Mom that lives next door and provides for his every need. He does have 3 young adult kids all who live out of town as well as 3 brothers, 1 is my husband and we live in Oklahoma and he is in Florida. He is unemployed and therefore has no medical insurance and is to young to be eligible to receive Medicare.\n\nI write all this just to put the situation out there and see if there is anyone else that finds themselves in a similar situation. We are at a loss as to how to help him. When he's threatening suicide or acts out in anger whether it's verbal or physical the police have been called out for wellness checks and we feel they are being ignored or not taken seriously. At this point since he refuses to go to the Dr. we feel like maybe we can get him taken to the hospital for a mental evaluation? No one wants that to happen but we are just not sure what to do or how to handle this.\n\nThank you for reading this if you have made it to the end! I helps to have a group like this to help you feel like we are not in this alone.",

When I was in the thick of my dementia journey caring for my mother-in-law, I was sitting at the kitchen table feeling exhausted, sad and very alone. When my thinking cleared a little, I realized that there were people all around the planet...likely sitting at their kitchen table feeling much the same. A short time later this group was born in the hopes that it would be a type of vehicle in bringing people together to support each other...people lost in the whirlwind of pain and frustration that this merciless disease creates.\nCurrently, I am the only admin...and I'll admit...it's becoming a little challenging to keep up with it considering all of the other demands that I'm facing daily. It's so very important to me that people who turn to this group get the help and support that they are needing so badly! So...given all of this, I'm putting out a call for persons who have dementia experience/knowledge (you don't have to have a medical degree...although we would love to have you if you do!) to let me know if you would be willing to become a moderator in this group. It would involve approving...or denying requests to join the group, responding to members' questions and concerns, providing support and encouragement as well as deleting any inappropriate posts and/or comments. Must have a caring heart. Best pay on the planet...knowing that you just might have reduced some of the pain and suffering in the world!! \ud83d\udc9d\n\nUPDATE: People responded to my plea! We have had several exceptional people step up to the plate as admins!! They are huge blessings to this group and I appreciate them beyond words! DCSG has grown so large and keeps growing rapidly...so I am still looking for moderators who can help support and effectively monitor this group. If that sounds like you (even if you can only manage coming on for short periods of time most days,) please reach out to me in a private message. \u2764",

She no longer drives. My husband and I spend one week per month with her, her daughter spends every weekend with her, and my daughter and her family spends Wednesday evenings with her. We want to keep her at home as long as possible as long as she is relatively safe. Her PCP advised us that placing her in a home will cause her to decline quickly.\n\nMy question - what is your experience with Wet Macular Degeneration? She has Dry Macular Degeneration in her right eye and requires no treatment at this time. She has Wet Macular Degeneration in her left eye and is receiving injections monthly by her retina doc. We are beginning to wonder if she needs to continue these treatments. She hates the injections and says there is no improvement.\n\nShe is the healthiest person I know. She takes no medications but does have her annual checkups just to make sure she doesn\u2019t need medications.\n\nBTW, we would bring her to our house before we let her go into a facility. Earlier this year we had some remodeling done to her home of the last 65 years. The entire time she was here, she experienced major memory problems. She thought our 38 year old son was 4 yrs old and kept looking for him, etc. when we took her back home, she got back to her old self.\n\nBTW, in this picture she is picking Louisiana blue berries in her daughter\u2019s backyard.",

    "text": "Im tired. I have promised since I was a little girl that i would never ever put them in a nursing home.its as if they knew!!! Daddy took care of my mom the last 18 yrs of his life. There was no use to try to convince him to put her in....he never left the hospital...if she was admitted....then so was he pretty much. These last few years ive been telling my kids how I CANT do it if daddy goes first. Well aug 9*2020 we lost daddy. I took responsibility for mom and she kept asking \"what's gonna happen to me???\" At the time i just kept saying you will be fine,i will stay with you and we vwill see how it goes. Well we all can guess at how it went....im still here!!! My health,which was bad before,which is whybi kept saying i couldnt do it, well it has suffered a great deal. Its too late now, she has been on a steady slow decline for several months.\nOne day she cant talk,hear, move ,wake up, then next day she can do some Of those things. Its so up-down- up.....i would never place her at this point. I have been given all the tools, diapers instead of pull ups.mouth sponges,lemon qtips for the lips, morphine for the breathing, used only once, and drops for secretions again used once. She sleeps in a hospital bedvin the LR of a one bedroom apartment... was a very light sleeper. So... she sleeps entire apt shuts down...no cooking,no laundry, no cleaning....so i retreat to my room where still i must be ever so quiet. Ive lost all my energy as i spend over 12 hrs a day in that room!!! Im so tired. I hurt from lifting and pullung on her,my PC tells me it is our duty and deal with it. Pain mgmt Dr does not vwant me lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk!!! He suggested nursing care. I feel so all alone. I think once my job is done here i need to live with my daughter instead of on my own which is what i wanted. Moving in with mom took me from living with my ex. Actually he lived with me,just refused to leave.\nI just feel so sad today. I try to think of my daddy today but my mind just won't allow it. Thanks for allowing me to vent... it helps!!! Prayers for everyone!!!",

But this was the worst Father\u2019s Day I\u2019ve ever had. 4 hours of ignoring me this morning because she was mad that I asked her NOT to call me her attractive Lover or handsome boyfriend/date to the tables around us in the restaurant yesterday. I sucked it up and took her out today. I sat in TJ Maxx, Marshall\u2019s, and lunch when I wasn\u2019t hungry. Came home and she wants me to do this, do that, fix her IPad, clean up her spills, go through and box up books. Etc. I\u2019M TIRED and want to just have a little quiet or special time with my Fianc\u00e9. God knows how I got engaged during this shit show I\u2019m living\u2026. 11:30pm at night now and I just want to go to bed but she\u2019s puttering around the house. Yesterday I also had to turn our stove off of high heat with an empty pan on it because she forgot. I really can\u2019t take much more, but tomorrow is another day. God please give me strength and a better attitude tomorrow.",

Pleas also note we have a paid caregiver who only works at my sister\u2019s; she won\u2019t come here anymore. Maybe because I want her to do things the right way?\n\nI\u2019m taking care of my 74 year old mom along with my sister; we alternate weeks. Last time I had her she came to me with redness on her bottom that I started treating, and when she left to go to my sister\u2019s, it was better. I told my sister what to do, and I knew she\u2019d gotten that way while she was there. My sister said \u2018well, she won\u2019t let the caregiver change her, so we can\u2019t do anything\u2019 and I told her she needs to stay off her bottom, kept clean, and to put the cream I gave her on everytime she\u2019s changed or goes to bathroom.\n\nMy sister today, when we traded mom off, said they\u2019d done everything like I said. Well I got her back today, and when I went to change her, her bottom looks like she\u2019s been boiled! Bright red with peeling blisters, like she had 2nd degree burns.\n\nI was so upset! I couldn\u2019t help but start crying. I tried not to let mom know. I took photos. I cleaned her up, treated the awful areas and left her naked from gown down on bed pads and on her side with pillows and made her nice and cozy with blankets.\n\nI know nobody is perfect, but is it too much to ask someone to just do the right thing for their mother? We\u2019ve had lots of similar incidents. When I got married, my mom didn\u2019t get a bath for the 10 days I was gone. I had to threaten to call APS to get her to take her blood sugar regularly.\n\nSorry this is so long. I\u2019m just so upset. This happened about 10:30 my time (eastern US) and I\u2019m still so upset I can\u2019t stand it. Idk how I\u2019ll sleep. Thanks for reading. I don\u2019t want her to go back to her house.",

Currently, he's able to function on a day to day basis, but we don't know how quickly things will progress. Of course there are so many things to consider and I'm overwhelmed with where to start. The doctor suggested a book to read, which has been helpful (The 36 Hour Day) and we've hired an attorney to start a trust and make medical/financial arrangements. But, what are some things you wish you'd known when your LO was first diagnosed? What are some things you've purchased that you love and wish you'd had sooner? I just ordered a digital calendar/clock for him and I'd love some things to keep him more aware and keep us better organized. Thanks!",

But really, all I wanted to say is I need help, I wanted to say I am hungry, I feel dizzy I wanted a miracle to happen, my life is not the same after Covid-19, in the end all I wanted was for someone to realize I need help , sometimes I open a smile and no one sees the pain behind it , today was a bad day , my son asked me for bread to eat and I didn't have any , the neighbors and they just gave me sugar , I had to give them sugar , sugar all day only that , the worst is that here there are no food banks unfortunately I live here in Brazil , here there is no help , no one realizes that we are all brothers , I wish all this would change \ud83d\ude2d although I know that tomorrow we will have nothing to eat , I really feel better to vent here in this group \ud83d\ude4f my biggest dream is that all this would end soon , I can't take it anymore,I received advice to prostitute myself , you know sell my body in exchange for food , I will need to become a whore , I just don't want to go through this anymore , I can't stand to see my two children hungry anymore , I am human , I also need food , I also need clothes , but what I have is just pain , it hurts too much to write these words , I don't even know if I will be understood I feel my chest hurts too much ! \ud83d\ude14 I just wanted you to pray for me, the churches that should help me are closed because of the pandemic, I already asked my friends for help, but they are in the same situation alive, I know we will spend a few more days with and it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to get help in this pandemic, I am only happy to be accepted in this wonderful group \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f",

It is important to provide older adults and their caregivers with knowledge on how to report abuse.\n\nShare this to as many people as you can, let's spread the message, and do our part for the wellbeing of our elders.\n\n#weaad #worldelderabuseawarenessday #aajicare #aarambh #eldercare #eldercareservices #eldercareathome #homecareforelder #eldercarecentre #geriatriccare #geriatriccounselling #geriatric #palliative",

    "text": "I'm constantly astounded by the speed of this insidious illness in my Godmother. She has no family at all, so I'm all she's got. By the beginning of September last year, I called her GP to ask about getting her tested as she seemed to be struggling to manage time and look after herself properly. The country was in lockdown and I lived 85 miles away. Her GP did nothing and as she was not remembering to eat and drink properly, she was rushed to A&E by the end of the month. At that stage, she was just a bit forgetful. Here we are only nine months later and the difference is shocking. She is in a care home which she believes is actually a hotel that she owns. She has photos in her room of herself and her late husband which she thinks are photos of the couple she bought the hotel from. Apparently her curtains are actually a pair of trousers. She walks very slowly and constantly has balance problems. When she is back on good(ish) form, you have about 15 minutes at best before the effort of concentrating gets too much for her and she slips away into her world again.\nWe moved her to a care home 5 minutes away from us and my wife and I take her to a local cafe once a week now for coffee and cakes.\nI'm trying to sort out her finances, late husbands estate and sell her house. I'm struggling to decide just how to plan someone's finances and care when I have no idea how long I need to plan for? All the info on the Internet suggests that she has anywhere from 3 to 5 years left. Yet, in 9 months, she has gone from having very mild dementia to having severe dementia and she's losing both her mobility and her bowel control.\n\nThe one thing I hang on to at the moment is that she's happy. She loves the \"hotel\", the food and all her new friends. She has no idea she can't remember things because if she can't remember something then she doesn't know she has forgotten it and she makes things up in her mind to fill in the gaps. I don't know how long she has left but I just hope and pray that she remains happy.",

And !! Where have you been ?? We have been doing this for TWO YEARS !!\nPlease email me at norrms@gmail.com thats TWO rr`s in norrms or I really won't get it xx\n\nFEEDBACK.....\n\nHi Norman,\nThe MP3 players have been an amazing tool for our patients living with dementia... They have provided such a calming influence.. some patients have found them so beneficial when they are in a busy ward dorm and a lot is going on and they just want to zone out and relax.. the music provided has been great for interaction also, some patients have remembered the words to some of the songs on the MP3 players and enjoy having a sing-song with myself. They have helped me to ensure the patients living with a dementia diagnosis and in-hospital have some more comfort... they have also helped me to identify the type of music the patients enjoy which is a great conversation starter. I wish to think you ever so much for the much-appreciated donation of the players, they have made such a difference..\n\nMany thanks\nLaura Clancy\nDementia Companion\nWaterside hospital",

(i thought to myself, \"bs, not after what i just heard\"\n\ni am delighted and fearful as i am not sure how long this will last. do i need to make dr appts for her? is this the plaques and tangles affecting different parts of the brain? or? is she just feeling good enough to reawaken a part of her she kept hidden for decades?\n\nthank you everyone, and many blessings \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96",

But in the meantime, please save the date so that you can celebrate with Les at his 126th hole when he completes his 125th hole!\n\nThank you!\n\n#mgc125 #teammgc #anniversary #125holes #charity #captain #mammothchallenge",

Along with an amazing experience, I won a 15,000 ft skydive! Something I have always wanted to try, but always found a reason not to, well, because I\u2019m a little terrified of the idea.\n\nSo on the 20/07/2019, I am going to do it! And I thought, what a great opportunity to raise some money for charity (and a great way to give me the motivation to not chicken out, haha).\n\nIn aid of Alzheimers and Dementia Support, and more specifically my dearest friend in the world, Joan, who gracefully lost her fight last year, I am jumping out of a plane! It\u2019d mean a great deal if I could have your support. Any donation would mean the world. And of course it\u2019ll be repaid with hysterical footage of the event itself. Wish me luck!\"\n\nTo wish her luck or to donate please visit: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/natasha-harker",

She\u2019s was hospitalized for three weeks because she can\u2019t sleep and is very unsteady. They kept her in one of those beds with a net around it to keep her safe, but she has the need to move all the time. And she still was not getting any sleep at night in the hospital. Anywhere from 30 min to 2 hours a night and it\u2019s not like she is taking giant naps during the day. The doctors said they\u2019re frustrated too and have adjusted meds several times. No improvement. She\u2019s back in memory care now and they called and said they don\u2019t think they\u2019re gonna be able to take care of her because she will not stop moving. She keeps walking up and down the hall. Pushing her walker the wrong way, all sweaty and worn out, and won\u2019t stop. Still no sleep. They think she might have to go to a psych ward. We live right down the street from her and see her everyday. We cry all the time. It\u2019s all we think about. My mom lives with us and I have to do everything for her. It\u2019s just so much and why can\u2019t my mol stay still?? It\u2019s killing us seeing her go through this!! Thanks for listening and input. God bless.",

    "text": "We just moved my mom into the house. She has moderate dementia, but gets around well. My problem is dealing with her incontinence. She has to wear a pull-up because of lack of good bladder control, and she really can\u2019t tell when she didn\u2019t hold it or not. She needs to change her pull-up when she wakes up and when she goes to bed, but when I mention it she loses her temper at me and I lose mine. Tonight, she announced she was going to bed. I notice her pants were wet so I ask her to check her underwear. It went downhill pretty fast. Any advice on this would be great. Just as a little more background, mom doesnt deal with grief normally. She typically gets angry. My brother died 10 years ago and since then she has taken her anger out on me. We have talked about it, but old habits die hard and when I mention something she doesn\u2019t like the anger resurfaces like tonight.",

    "text": "Hi all, when does this ever end, I just spoke to my mother in the care facility and she keeps on saying how can you do this to me (putting her in the care facility) mom is 84 at the end of our conversation she hung up on me.\nIt does hurt to hear her so upset and angry at me every day.\nToday she is stating I am going to regret this decision keeping her in the facility vs being home with me. The back story is I have had her living with me since 2009 and the past 3 years under hospice care in my home at which time I hired a caregiver while I am at work. This past Nov she now has been in and out of the hospital 13x. She is angry at the world but most of all me. I have been so honest with her that I cannot take care of her any longer nor to be honest its taken a toll on me and my wellness and because of this I feel so guilty. Every day she fights with me and cries, I am at the point where I dread the daily calls as she knows how to push my buttons. I am the only child and have no one to share taking care of her, but I do have a cousin that she adores but I don't see her saying I can help. I want the best for my mom, how can you love the parent but cannot deal with them or even like them anymore. My heart is heavy but my mind says I have done the right thing for her. I had a knee replacement 4 weeks ago and I am still recovering, please understand I do love my mom but I just can't do this with her anymore. I Apologize for venting and I am not looking for anything. As I realize she may be right I will regret this Decision someday.\n\nThank you all for listening. GOD BLESS &\nI APOLOGIZE FOR THIS LONG WINDED NOTE",
