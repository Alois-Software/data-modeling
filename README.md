# Alois Software data-modeling Repo

## Getting Started

**1. Clone the repo**
- **Note:** I recommend using the official GitHub client app to make version control simple
    
**2. Choose your IDE/text editor (we love VS Code)**

**3. Visit out MongoDB project page [here](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/615889d84e2afc714621100a#clusters) and add a new user under Database Access (use your name) and your IP Address using the Network Access tab on the left (click on add IP Address and then current IP address)**


**4. Create a new .env file in the top level directory of the project and add your database url (Click Connect on the alois cluster, then Connect your application. Should be link under point 2) using the form DATABASE_URL=<copy link here>. Be sure to replace the username and password with your username and password (make sure your password is urlencoded, you can do that [here](https://www.urlencoder.org/) and replace MyFirstDatabase with test**

**5. `npm install` then `npm start` to get the server running.**

**6. Get the server up-and-running! Let me know if you have any issues.**


## Making Changes
#### We'll be using a "Feature Branch Workflow". If you aren't familiar with this and want to learn more, here's a [5-minute guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) explaining the workflow. 

#### These are the steps we will follow:
**1. Sync your local repo with the main repo**  
  
**2. Create your own branch** 
  - **Note:** make your feature/branch name descriptive!
  
**3. Write code for new feature, adding and committing along the way**  
  - **Note:** Commit after each incremental piece of functionality you create and use descriptive commit messages!
  
**4. Rebase your branch on the main branch**

**4. Push commits to your new-feature branch in the remote repository**  

**5. File a pull request on GitHub.com**

**6. Shravan/Himanshu review merge changes**
